**Summary:** In recent decades women’s educational attainment has increasingly come to surpass men’s. While recent work made strides in incorporating cultural models of gender into accounts of this reversal, it has implicitly assumed that these models have themselves remained substantively constant. In this article, we apply neural network word embeddings to a 200-million-word corpus of American print media (1930-2009) to examine whether and how these cultural models have changed. Our approach lets us estimate the extent to which each of over 10,000 English words occurs in feminine versus masculine contexts at different time points. We use this to track the changing gendered connotations of terms related to school, studying, socio-behavioral skills, behavioral problems, intelligence, and unintelligence. Our results point to three ideal-typical trajectories: (1) socio-behavioral skills and behavioral problems start out significantly feminine and masculine, respectively, and retain those connotations throughout the entire time period; (2) school and studying start out without significant gendered connotations, but finish with significant feminine connotations; (3) intelligence and unintelligence start out neutral or slightly feminine but finish significantly masculine. There is an exceptionally strong negative correlation between trends (2) and (3), which leads us to speculate that both changes are part of one overarching cultural shift.

**Andrei Boutyline**'s research focuses on culture, cognition, methodology, and public opinion. He examines the supra-individual aspects of attitudes, tastes, and cognitive representations, with a special focus on political views. He is broadly interested in the society-wide distribution of these cultural elements, and the social and cognitive processes that give rise to this distribution. He draws on network analysis, statistics, and computer science to develop novel methods for these investigations. In a separate research stream, he studies the effects of political disagreement on social network structure. His work has appeared in the *American Journal of Sociology*, *Sociological Science*, and *Political Psychology*.

**Summary:** Research on belief formation has produced contradictory findings on whether and when
communication between group members will improve the accuracy of estimations such as
economic forecasts, medical diagnoses, and job candidate assessments. While some evidence
suggests that carefully mediated processes (i.e., the “Delphi method”) produce more accurate
beliefs than unstructured discussion, others argue that unstructured discussion outperforms
mediated processes. Still others argue that independent individuals produce the most accurate
beliefs. This paper shows how network theories of belief formation can resolve these
inconsistencies. Emergent network structures of influence—even in groups with no apparent
structure, such as committees—interact with the pre-discussion belief distribution to moderate the
effect of communication on belief formation. As a result, communication sometimes increases and
sometimes decreases the accuracy of the average belief in a group. The effects differ for mediated
processes and unstructured communication, such that the relative benefit of each communication
format depends on both group dynamics as well as the statistical properties of pre-interaction
beliefs. These results resolve contradictions in previous research and offer practical
recommendations for teams and organizations.

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Research on belief formation has produced contradictory findings on whether and when communication between group members will improve the accuracy of estimations such as economic forecasts, medical diagnoses, and job candidate assessments. While some evidence suggests that carefully mediated processes (i.e., the “Delphi method”) produce more accurate beliefs than unstructured discussion, others argue that unstructured discussion outperforms mediated processes. Still others argue that independent individuals produce the most accurate beliefs. This paper shows how network theories of belief formation can resolve these inconsistencies. Emergent network structures of influence—even in groups with no apparent structure, such as committees—interact with the pre-discussion belief distribution to moderate the effect of communication on belief formation. As a result, communication sometimes increases and sometimes decreases the accuracy of the average belief in a group. The effects differ for mediated processes and unstructured communication, such that the relative benefit of each communication format depends on both group dynamics as well as the statistical properties of pre-interaction beliefs. These results resolve contradictions in previous research and offer practical recommendations for teams and organizations.</p>

<strong>Joshua Becker</strong> is a postdoctoral fellow at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, and a researcher in residence at the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems. Joshua completed his PhD at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania. Prior to graduate school, he worked professionally in mediation and conflict resolution and now serves as a pro-bono mediator with the Chicago Conflict Resolution Center. His research has been published in Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Harvard Business Review.

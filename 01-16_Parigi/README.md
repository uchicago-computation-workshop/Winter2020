**Summary:** Trust is a fundamental prerequisite in the growth and sustainability
of sharing economy platforms. Many of such platforms rely on
actions that require trust to take place, such as entering a stranger’s
car or sleeping at a stranger’s place. For this reason, understanding,
measuring, and tracking trust can be of great benefit to such platforms,
enabling them to identify trust behaviors, both online and
offline, and identify groups which may benefit from trust-building
interventions. In this work, we present the design and evaluation
of a behavioral framework to measure a user’s propensity to trust
others on Airbnb. We conducted an online experiment with 4,499
Airbnb users in the form of an investment game in order to capture
users’ propensity to trust other users on Airbnb. Then, we used the
experimental data to generate both explanatory and predictive models
of trust propensity. Our contribution is a framework that can
be used to measure trust propensity in sharing economy platforms
via online and offline signals. We discuss which affordances need
to be in place so that sharing economy platforms can get signals of
trust, in addition to how such a framework can be used to inform
design around trust in the short and long term.
